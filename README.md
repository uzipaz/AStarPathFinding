# A*

A* is my favourite algorithm. It is basically Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with an added interesting element 'Heuristic'. Heuristics are custom measurements between two points in a problem that we can use to alter how the algorithm will go about finding the solution within that problem. For example, Euclidean distance or simply put straight line distance between two points is the most commonly used heuristic in Path-finding problems. 

I wrote this program as part of Artificial Intelligence course I took in my Bachelor's Degree and really enjoyed writing it. I tried my best to keep the code as much readable and clean as possible and to optimise my PriorityQueue class (I implemented Heap based PriorityQueue because of logarithmic run-time for both push and pop operations).
